        <div class="boxone">Diabetes mellitus is a constellation of diseases that affect how the body utilizes blood sugar. As a vital component of health and source of energy for body cells, glucose regulation is essential to maintain homeostatis, which is controlled by hormones such as insulin, glucagon and glucocorticoids. Dysfunction in homeostatic mechanisms may lead to excess sugar in the blood which may exert deleterious health problems. According to DK’s history and physical data,  an 18-year-old high school student who, despite a ravenous appetite is experiencing weight loss, frequent trips to the bathroom, and fatigue, one may conclude that DK has type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although type 1 diabetes may develop at any age, children and adolescents are more susceptible to the condition. </div>
